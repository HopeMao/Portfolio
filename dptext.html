“Home is at your fingertips”

Roommates need an efficient and user intuitive way to distribute tasks and streamline communication in order to lessen conflict and save time.

The purpose of Mynest is to provide the college/student demographic with an easy and quick way to organize the process of living together. All the while, Mynest exercises communication and organizational skills as young adults navigate their way through adulthood with Mynest.
Mynest is unique because it caters towards roommates specifically. Many apps on the market exist for family settings, or solely for the organization of tasks. Mynest combines the efficiency of task apps while offering a holistic organizational environment similar to family organizational apps. By dissociating from family style home apps, Mynest offers a more casual and simple interface, with less specialization in features like monitoring or control over other users and focuses on a younger demographic.

Outcomes/Benefits:
Users can expect to spend less face time physically meeting and deliberating about chores or payments. With easy to add tasks and events, a step in the communication process can be bypassed. Mynest allows users to view activity happening within their homes and look back on completed chores. Having documentation on hand is an easy solution to small conflicts that users might have when dealing with responsibilities. Users can also expect a faster and low maintenance method of communication with features that display whether you’re home, and an activity log in the homescreen. Users will be incentivized by a point system that dishes out points to whoever completes a chore. Lastly, Mynest integrates a simple safety feature where users can indicate if they are on their way home and fellow roommates will receive that notification. If location tracking is enabled, they can view your location to ensure that you get home safely.

Audience/Personas:
Our primary audience are college and graduate roommates or students and the working class. The age demographic is catered towards young adults and is meant for long term usage between strangers or friends (at least a few months).
Our secondary audience includes short term roommates (together for a few weeks/months). Whether it be for work, travel purposes or seasonal camps, users of any age that need an organizational tool to coordinate with strangers or friends may turn to Mynest.
While not our primary concern, a family household may also find our app useful. Because our app doesn’t specify a certain demographics, it is entirely possible that a family may use this app. While it lacks family-style features like allowance and parental control, this may still be useful to those seeking Mynest’s unique and user intuitive features that distribute and track tasks.

Key Features:
Activity: This is the homepage/default screen of the app. It provides a simple overview of upcoming tasks, events, and a log of all recent activity.

Tasks: The task page lists all upcoming/unfinished tasks with most pressing tasks at the top. There is also an option to pin important tasks and have them stay at the top until completion/deletion. At the top is also a shortcut to the user’s personal tasks– divided by incomplete and completed tasks and sorted chronologically. At the top is also a directory to completed tasks. By swiping on a specific task, there are options to mark as done, delete, edit, and nude (to remind the assigned person to do their task).

People: This page displays all the roommates that have been added to your household. It also displays their current amount of points, and if they have invited any guests over. Clicking on a user’s picture/name will take you to their page where you can see their contact info, the tasks assigned to them, and tasks they have completed.

Calendar: This page displays a calendar with all tasks marked with a circle: completed task are marked green, and upcoming tasks marked grey. There are also small orange dots which indicate a household event like a meeting or potluck. At the top is a signifier showing how many upcoming events there are within the month. Clicking on a specific day displays information at the bottom detailing the type of task/event.

Messageboard: The messageboard is a basic chat room that allows users to communicate within the app– this allows them to keep all living based conversations local. There is also an option to attach photos/files.

Safety: The “Who’s Home” section is a fairly unique feature that allows users to share their location when coming home- which can be automatically shut off when they arrive home, or manually adjusted. The house icon will be fully filled with green depending on what fraction of the roommates are present. The “home” status can also be toggled in the side vertical navigation.

Mynest aims to be an SLC product. One could argue that Mynest is an MVP product due to its multiple features. However, Only the most basic and essential features are rendered and are designed minimally to work well. More features could be added in the future: like payment tracking, google calendar linking, or more location services. However, as it stands, this app is functional and provides the basic necessities that a roommate might need to organize their home life.
